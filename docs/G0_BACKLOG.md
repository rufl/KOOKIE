# G0 implementation backlog

[Português (Brasil)](../pt-BR/docs/G0_BACKLOG.md)

This is the active bounded implementation sequence after the initial research and contract commits.

## Completed

- Modular `core`/`session` Kof source and scalar SDL3 probe.
- Bilingual documentation and push verification gate.
- Checked Kof-owned resource tokens with slot, generation and kind validation.
- JVM/native regression smoke and three named regression tests.
- Scalar `SDL_Init(0)`/`SDL_Quit()` lifecycle exercised on JVM/native.
- Kof-owned focus/resize/close state and bounded FIFO audio queue.
- Narrow C SDL adapter with checked window/audio/GPU tokens and scalar event flattening.
- Bounded PCM silence and deterministic clip transfer into an SDL audio stream without callbacks.
- Native adapter probe applying real adapter events to Kof state and running the first SPIR-V texture upload/draw path.
- Bounded Kof frame staging contract measured at 15 scalar writes for a three-vertex textured triangle, with publish/discard ownership checks.
- Native exception lifetime reproducer and negative controls recorded in the verification gate.
- Native adapter exposes elapsed GPU draw timing after GPU-idle retirement.
- G1 fixed-step clock, bounded input commands with fire/jump edge transitions, loopback server/client snapshot sync, and bounded integer component storage.
- G1 two-client loopback admission, per-client input sequencing, stale snapshot rejection, bounded authoritative movement, and camera/input clamping.
- Isolated native smoke accepted hidden-window lifecycle, resize/focus flattening, dummy audio, stale-token teardown, and clean process cleanup; GPU reported unavailable.
- Bounded client snapshot history with integer interpolation and explicit prediction/reconciliation authority boundaries.
- Bounded scalar collision queries with clamped movement resolution and out-of-bounds placement rejection.
- Bounded prediction input history (capacity eight) with replay across authoritative reconciliation; server state remains authoritative.
- Bounded integer 3D segment sweep queries through an axis-aligned volume, rejecting starting penetration and over-budget traversal.

## Next batch

1. Expose a usable isolated SDL_GPU backend or render node; then record `gpu-open`, draw completion, and measured GPU-idle retirement.
2. Compare elapsed native draw time and frame retirement against the declared frame budget once GPU timing is available.
3. Re-run the native exception-handler reproducer after a compiler upgrade; require stale output change before trusting exception cleanup.
4. Extend the bounded segment query toward triangle/BVH tests and capsule movement before weapons.
5. Integrate shared bounded spatial queries for player, projectile and line-of-sight admission.
6. Record each new measured failure or acceptance boundary in both language trees.

## Deferred

- Textured mesh renderer and shader pipeline beyond the first smoke draw.
- Full 3D collision/BVH, weapons, enemies, content cooking, save schema and multiplayer transport.
- Production audio, image/text services, package compression and foreign physics/UI libraries.


Do not replace a blocked native capability with JVM fallback, a hidden C engine, a fake-success stub or an unverified graphics scaffold.

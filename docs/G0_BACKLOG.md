# G0 implementation backlog

[Português (Brasil)](../pt-BR/docs/G0_BACKLOG.md)

This is the active bounded implementation sequence after the initial research and contract commits.

## Completed

- Modular `core`/`session` Kof source and scalar SDL3 probe.
- Bilingual documentation and push verification gate.
- Checked Kof-owned resource tokens with slot, generation and kind validation.
- JVM/native regression smoke and three named regression tests.
- Scalar `SDL_Init(0)`/`SDL_Quit()` lifecycle exercised on JVM/native.
- Kof-owned focus/resize/close state and bounded FIFO audio queue.
- Narrow C SDL adapter with checked window/audio/GPU tokens and scalar event flattening.
- Bounded PCM silence and deterministic clip transfer into an SDL audio stream without callbacks.
- Native adapter probe applying real adapter events to Kof state and running the first SPIR-V texture upload/draw path.
- Bounded Kof frame staging contract measured at 15 scalar writes for a three-vertex textured triangle, with publish/discard ownership checks.
- Native exception lifetime reproducer and negative controls recorded in the verification gate.
- Native adapter exposes elapsed GPU draw timing after GPU-idle retirement.
- G1 fixed-step clock, bounded input commands with fire/jump edge transitions, loopback server/client snapshot sync, and bounded integer component storage.
- G1 two-client loopback admission, per-client input sequencing, stale snapshot rejection, bounded authoritative movement, and camera/input clamping.
- Isolated native smoke accepted hidden-window lifecycle, resize/focus flattening, dummy audio, stale-token teardown, and clean process cleanup; GPU reported unavailable for window presentation.
- Bounded client snapshot history with integer interpolation and explicit prediction/reconciliation authority boundaries.
- Bounded scalar collision queries with clamped movement resolution and out-of-bounds placement rejection.
- Bounded prediction input history (capacity eight) with replay across authoritative reconciliation; server state remains authoritative.
- Bounded integer 3D segment sweep queries through an axis-aligned volume, rejecting starting penetration and over-budget traversal.
- Bounded integer triangle queries with degenerate-triangle rejection and previous-sample resolution.
- Bounded capsule center movement with radius-expanded bounds and shared player/projectile/line-of-sight admission.
- Isolated offscreen SDL_GPU device and SPIR-V draw accepted with render-node exposure; the latest smoke measured 1638 microseconds for three draws against the declared 16,667-microsecond frame budget on `renderD129`.
- Fixed-step clock exposes the declared 60 Hz frame budget to GPU acceptance checks.
- Bounded triangle collections use a fixed-capacity deterministic binary BVH with nearest-hit selection and traversal diagnostics.
- Bounded capsule movement now returns authoritative slide/step results and the shared spatial gate exposes the result.

## Next batch

1. Add a DRI3-capable isolated presentation path for window screenshots; Xvfb remains presentation-incompatible.
2. Re-run the native exception-handler reproducer after a compiler upgrade; require stale output change before trusting exception cleanup.
3. Add an explicit bounded step-obstacle fixture and prove successful step traversal, not only slide fallback.
4. Extend triangle collection maintenance with bounded removal/rebuild and stable geometry revisions.
5. Build the textured mesh renderer beyond the first smoke draw, then measure the full frame staging budget.
6. Record each new measured failure or acceptance boundary in both language trees.

## Deferred

- Full physics, weapons, enemies, content cooking, save schema and multiplayer transport.
- Production audio, image/text services, package compression and foreign physics/UI libraries.


Do not replace a blocked native capability with JVM fallback, a hidden C engine, a fake-success stub or an unverified graphics scaffold.
